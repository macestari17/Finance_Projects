# Finance Projects Repository 📊

This repository contains Python-based projects inspired by concepts from my MBA in Applied Finance. Since much of my academic work has been theoretical or conducted using Excel, I created these projects to apply those concepts in Python for practical use.

The projects cover portfolio management, risk analysis, and financial forecasting, with a focus on implementing financial models and calculations.
